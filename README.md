# Gui-Simplex-Algorithm-Implementation-Python
Console and gui implementation of the simplex algorithm
Modules needed: Numpy, Sympy, PyQt5
This project implements a popular operations research algorithm known as the simplex algorithm

Simplex.py - Contains functions for manipulating the simplex tableau
Augment.py - Contains functions for augmenting the problem, deriving basis variables etc. In other words, all other activities 
needed to form the simplex tableau
Console.py - Console version
Gui.py - Gui version
